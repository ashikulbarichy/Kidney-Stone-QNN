# 🧠🔬 Quantum Neural Network for Early-Stage Kidney Stone Diagnosis

This repository contains our research and development work on **Quantum Machine Learning (QML)** models for early-stage detection of **kidney stones**, leveraging the potential of **Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs)**. This project is part of academic curriculam of North South University under the course: Directed Research(CSE498).

> **"Quantum ML Enhanced Early Stage Kidney Stone Diagnosis"**

## 🚀 Project Overview

Kidney stones are a common urological condition, and early diagnosis can significantly reduce patient discomfort and medical costs. Traditional machine learning methods have shown promise in medical diagnostics, but quantum computing opens new frontiers by enabling faster computation and better optimization in high-dimensional spaces.

In this project, we:

- Investigate the application of different Quantum ML models. I am working on **Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs)** in classifying kidney stone presence from early-stage diagnostic features.
- Compare performance between classical and quantum-enhanced models.
- Explore quantum circuits using **PennyLane**, **Qiskit**, and hybrid models integrating classical neural networks with quantum layers.

## 🛠 Technologies & Frameworks

- 🔬 Qiskit by IBM
- ⚛️ Qiskit ML Libraries
- 📊 NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data analysis and visualization)
- 🧼 Scikit-learn (for preprocessing and baseline comparisons)


## 📊 Dataset

We are using public dataset from Mendley Data. Features include:

- Ultrasound Images labeled by Stone or No-Stone

## 🔍 Research Goals

- Design and test **parameterized quantum circuits** (PQCs) for medical classification tasks.
- Explore three different Quantum ML models- **Quantum Neural Network**,**Quantum Convolutional Neural Network** & **Hybrid Quantum Convolutional Neural Network**.
- Compare performance with different QML models.
